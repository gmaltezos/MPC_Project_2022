% BRIEF:
%   Template for explicit invariant set computation. You MUST NOT change
%   the output.
% INPUT:
%   Q, R: State and input weighting matrix
% OUTPUT:
%   H, h: Describes polytopic X_LQR = {x | H * x <= h}

function [H, h] = lqr_maxPI(Q,R,params)
	% YOUR CODE HERE
    % Parameter initialisation

    B = params.model.B;

    % Gain of LQR controller
    [F,~,~] = dlqr(A, B, Q, R);
    K = F;

    % Resulting LTI system with the lqr controller
    system = LTISystem('A', A - B*K);
    
    % The constraints should not be hardcoded, because in every test
    % scenario, they provide a different system.
